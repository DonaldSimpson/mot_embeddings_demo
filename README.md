# MOT Embeddings Demo

A lightweight demo showing how to turn messy MOT defect notes into **embeddings** using [MiniLM](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and then apply:

- **Clustering** (to group similar defects together)
- **Semantic search** (to find related defects by meaning, not just keywords)

This is a simplified example of techniques used in [CarHunch](https://www.carhunch.com), my vehicle insights platform.
